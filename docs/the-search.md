#The Search For Your Home
As you start your search, you have by now decided that you want to buy a house for a combination of many reasons, most probably because somewhere in there you thought to yourself "owning is much better than renting" (financially and otherwise). Well, now you need to decide many other things, how much work and responsibility are you ready for (type of house) and how most importantly, what is within your grasp, financially.

## Variables To Look For
### Price
The first and foremost thing you need to set in your mind is the base price of the house that you are capable/willing to expend on the home purchase. The basic points you need to keep in your mind is that you:
 
* do **not** want to spend all your savings.
* have to save enough to furnish the house later on.
* be ready to deal with any repairs that will definitely 'surprise' you after you buy the house.
* need to have a monthly payment that still gives you enough breathing room to save every paycheck.

The way to get to this is way more complicated than it sounds. You will be able to envision the complete picture after you find out all the parts of the process. But for now, the major thing you need to keep in mind is those points. 

You can use any simple [Mortgage Calculators](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/) available online (no need to understand the details) and see if the monthly payment after paying about 10% down and at current interest rates allows you to save a realistic amount of your paycheck.

### Types of Homes
One of the THE major things you need to fix your mind on is what type of house you are planning to get, two different types of homes with the same price tag do not mean the same thing. There are multiple types of homes, which entail their own kind of responsibilities. Let's look through them.
#### Townhome
As a first time home owner, I decided to go with a townhome because I found them to have the best balance of responsibility and price. Townhomes are the types of home which you might have called "row-homes" by mistake at some point or the other. An easy mistake to do, because they literally are a row of homes, however, these homes are not usually directly on the road like row-homes usually are. These are one of the most common types of developments, where they have 4 to 5 individual homes attached to each other with a firewall separating each of them (internally).

There many such groups of townhomes together in a development, and all of them together have their own Home Owners' Association which will take care of maintaining the common areas and tending to the other needs of the community as a whole. In addition to your monthly rent, you will usually have to pay a quarterly HOA fee, which covers all the HOA related tasks.

**Pros:**

* They have very small back/front-years so outside-home maintenance is minimal.
* You can easily learn any/all inside-home maintenance related tasks that come with home-ownership, as it has everything a regular house would.
* As these are not part of a Building (condominium), there will be no "Condo" (maintenance)fee.

**Cons:**

* Changes to the external look of your house will need HOA approval.
* Depending on the HOA, it might have more rules than necessary and complicate your modifications.
* There is not as much privacy, as no matter how isolating the firewall is, sound always passes through to other homes.

####Condos
These are the other "entry level" type homes, Condos (Condominiums) are basically like apartment buildings where you can buy individual apartment homes. Depending on the type of Condo it is, it will have varying sizes of apartment sizes. They might feel like the best choice at first, but what I have found is that they usually end up costing much more than similar priced townhomes. The catch to the no-maintenance lifestyle of Condos is that everything is handled by the Condo people, for which there would be a monthly Condo fee. That doesn't mean there is no HOA fee, Condos usually have both, a quarterly HOA fee and a Monthly Condo Fee. 

The Condo fee is for all the maintenance and the amenities they provide, and based on what they provide it can end up being as high as $300 per month. No part of the Condo fee is deductible in taxes (which is one of th best benefits you get from home-ownership). It significantly increases your monthly payments, so I did not find these to be a good deal in any way. 

**Pros:**

* Condos require the least amount of effort from owner for it's up-keep (among all types of homes)
* Usually the only types found in more developed, downtown-like areas (with lack of area)
* Great as investment properties because of their rental possibilities and location.

**Cons:**

* Very high, non-deductible, Condo fees that are subject to hike as years go by.
* Condo fee is in addition to HOA Fees.
* Monthly payment for a similar priced house would be much lesser.

####Single Family Homes
These are the ones that are a step above the Townhomes in terms of privacy, area, and things-to-do. You can find Townhomes and Single Family Homes for similar prices in similar areas, however, there are many things to consider before getting a Single Family Home. It has larger area, which means more lawn to mow, more area to look after, and also, a higher property tax every year. You will have many outside-home maintenance tasks to do, which I would definitely recommend avoiding for first time home owners. 

I chose to learn things step-by-step and leave that option for later, if that happens.

**Pros:**

* More Privacy
* No HOA fee (depending on the community)
* The Area such homes are in are usually secluded or in more calmer locations, away from all the buzz.
* Interaction with neighbors will be minimal.

**Cons:**

* Lots of things to take care of. (high responsibility)
* May not be convenient depending on how far it is from Amenities.
* Interaction with neighbors will be minimal.


####Other types

There are many other affordable types like duplexes, and others, which you can approach on a case to case basis, there are also others like mansions, which is out of the scope for this. But the above three types are the ones that you will mostly come across in all of America. They all are made from wood inside, there is no RCC inside the homes. The only time you will see bricks is probably in the basement or outside-walls. The wood nature of the homes in U.S. make them into a type of huge Lego set, you can make holes anywhere with easy, and still hang heavy things off walls (if you find studs). You can even patch holes if you make one. Everything is easy to do and these are the things you would be learning after living in your own house.

### Area and Location
Once you know which type of house are you are getting, the next step of figuring out how large you want the house to be (area in Square Feet.) is same for no matter which type of house you choose to buy. You need to have an idea of how many bedrooms you want, and what is possible in your budget. 

But the next most important thing you will have to deal with is the Location of the house. There are many factors that people look for when they are trying to search for areas. Most people chose to first buy house in a suburban area with good schools and amenities. 

#### Schools
Because in U.S basic school education, from Kindergarten till 12th Grade (K-12), and because private schools are extremely expensive (unlike in India where most people go to private schools), the biggest thing to understand here is that the (public) school a child can go to is limited by the distance from where they live.

For this reason, it is very essential to choose a place in a good "school district" if you are planning to have kids and stay in the same area until they start going to school. All the information on school grades and such are public information and because of this all the apps that show you homes guide you to give a general idea of the schools. Of course, if you are really serious about the school, the ratings are only a guide and actually going to them and checking them out, talking to people, would be the best way to decide.

#### Amenities
The type of amenities people look for are things like how far away it is from Grocery stores, how many parks the area has, how is the local library system, and other things. Being at walkable distance or a short drive away from all Amenities and conveniences is a definite plus for most people. If you are looking for a place that is far away from all that, they are usually the case for Single Family Homes. Most of the amenities are same throughout a county, and the quality changes as change counties or near the bordering parts of counties. County is like "District" (Zilla) level of subdivision in a state if you want to compare it to Indian geographical divisions.

#### Other Variables
You will be looking at many other things like Crime Rate, Proximity to highways, number of homes in a community, greenery, and other things, most of which all will be easily available as filters in any of the apps you use.

## Use Apps First

The initial search for the right home should start with an app. You just install one of the popular free apps. I would recommend Zillow or RedFin, and then using these apps you can use all kinds of filters to figure out what is in your budget. 

Using apps can be one of the most addictive experience, all you need to do first is be sure of what values you will set all the filters to. What is the price range, what is the school rating, what is the age of the house, what is the county etc. You don't have to know what qualities you are looking for, as all will be available to you as part of the filters in the app's Advanced Search options. 

Once you are comfortable with what filters you want to set, you can start panning and scanning around all maps (which is great if done on desktop computers with large monitors) and start shortlisting all possible homes. All apps have good set of pictures for places and you can always use Google Street View to get a better idea of what the place is like. 

The apps will probably stay with you until you find the final house you are buying, so I would recommend first start getting comfortable with using the apps and looking at homes, which will give a good idea of the whole base level of qualities to look for.

##Open Houses

Once you have started getting comfortable with shortlisting Houses on apps, start looking for places that offer open houses, the apps tell you that too. Open House is when the seller decides to leave the House Open, with their selling agent in the house and have people just walk straight right in through the front door, without needing any kind of appointments. 

The advantage here is that you (as a buyer) can go into these houses and look at the place at your own pace. You can do this without having an Agent work for you. So take advantage of this and go to as many Open House (at different locations and of different type) as you can before looking to get really serious about buying houses. 

Once you start looking at Open Houses, you will get a very good idea of what is the difference between looking at things on the app Vs actually being there. You will also have less pressure as you will not have an agent with you. Just look around and figure out what you want and once you have a very clear idea, you start looking at getting an agent to represent you in the house purchase.

##Finding an Agent

The chances are, even though you have a very clear idea of what you want, after looking at all the apps and then going to open houses, you still haven't found "THE" House that you are looking for. This is where the Agent comes in. Not only will they help you with finding more homes, they will also help you in getting through the purchase of the house. Technically, the database they have and the ones you see on the apps are more or less identical, but it will be like having another set of eyes looking out for your best interest, so they might find something you might have missed, etc. 

There are many things to consider before actually looking at homes with an agent. Many fear that agents usually want to up-sell a house to you, because they get commission on the sale, so the higher the price of the house, the higher the commission. While it is true they get commission (out of the seller's pocket, in many states), that does not they might always be looking to do that. 

The most common way of finding an Agent is from recommendation, you will probably have someone close to you that might have bought house recently (colleague, friend, or friend of a friend) and that way you can actually get recommendation people you trust. The other method people usually find agents is via Open Houses, it is very common that when you are going to an Open House and the selling agent sees that you have no agent, they might start trying to become your buying agent. 

Be it recommendation or on your own, you will have to spend some time talking and going out with the agent before deciding if they are the one you want to go through the whole Home Purchase process.
