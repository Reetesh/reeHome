#The Search For Your Home
As you start your search, you have by now decided that you want to buy a house for a combination of many reasons, most probably because somewhere in there you thought to yourself "owning is much better than renting" (financially and otherwise). Well, now you need to decide many other things, how much work and responsibility are you ready for (type of house) and how most importantly, what is within your grasp, financially.

## Variables To Look For
### Price
The first and foremost thing you need to set in your mind is the base price of the house that you are capable/willing to expend on the home purchase. The basic points you need to keep in your mind is that you:
 
* do **not** want to spend all your savings.
* have to save enough to furnish the house later on.
* be ready to deal with any repairs that will definitely 'surprise' you after you buy the house.
* need to have a monthly payment that still gives you enough breathing room to save every paycheck.

The way to get to this is way more complicated than it sounds. You will be able to envision the complete picture after you find out all the parts of the process. But for now, the major thing you need to keep in mind is those points. 

You can use any simple [Mortgage Calculators](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/) available online (no need to understand the details) and see if the monthly payment after paying about 10% down and at current interest rates allows you to save a realistic amount of your paycheck.

### Types of Homes
One of the THE major things you need to fix your mind on is what type of house you are planning to get, two different types of homes with the same price tag do not mean the same thing. There are multiple types of homes, which entail their own kind of responsibilities. Let's look through them.
#### Townhome
As a first time home owner, I decided to go with a townhome because I found them to have the best balance of responsibility and price. Townhomes are the types of home which you might have called "row-homes" by mistake at some point or the other. An easy mistake to do, because they literally are a row of homes, however, these homes are not usually directly on the road like row-homes usually are. These are one of the most common types of developments, where they have 4 to 5 individual homes attached to each other with a firewall separating each of them (internally).

There many such groups of townhomes together in a development, and all of them together have their own Home Owners' Association which will take care of maintaining the common areas and tending to the other needs of the community as a whole. In addition to your monthly rent, you will usually have to pay a quarterly HOA fee, which covers all the HOA related tasks.

**Pros:**

* They have very small back/front-years so outside-home maintenance is minimal.
* You can easily learn any/all inside-home maintenance related tasks that come with home-ownership, as it has everything a regular house would.
* As these are not part of a Building (condominium), there will be no "Condo" (maintenance)fee.

**Cons:**

* Changes to the external look of your house will need HOA approval.
* Depending on the HOA, it might have more rules than necessary and complicate your modifications.
* There is not as much privacy, as no matter how isolating the firewall is, sound always passes through to other homes.

####Condos
These are the other "entry level" type homes, Condos (Condominiums) are basically like apartment buildings where you can buy individual apartment homes. Depending on the type of Condo it is, it will have varying sizes of apartment sizes. They might feel like the best choice at first, but what I have found is that they usually end up costing much more than similar priced townhomes. The catch to the no-maintenance lifestyle of Condos is that everything is handled by the Condo people, for which there would be a monthly Condo fee. That doesn't mean there is no HOA fee, Condos usually have both, a quarterly HOA fee and a Monthly Condo Fee. 

The Condo fee is for all the maintenance and the amenities they provide, and based on what they provide it can end up being as high as $300 per month. No part of the Condo fee is deductible in taxes (which is one of th best benefits you get from home-ownership). It significantly increases your monthly payments, so I did not find these to be a good deal in any way. 

**Pros:**

* Condos require the least amount of effort from owner for it's up-keep (among all types of homes)
* Usually the only types found in more developed, downtown-like areas (with lack of area)

**Cons:**

* Very high, non-deductible, Condo fees that are subject to hike as years go by.
* Condo fee is in addition to HOA Fees.
* Monthly payment for a similar priced house would be much lesser.

####Single Family Homes
These are the ones that are a step above the Townhomes in terms of privacy, area, and things-to-do. You can find Townhomes and Single Family Homes for similar prices in similar areas, however, there are many things to consider before getting a Single Family Home. It has larger area, which means more lawn to mow, more area to look after, and also, a higher property tax every year. You will have many outside-home maintenance tasks to do, which I would definitely recommend avoiding for first time home owners. 

I chose to learn things step-by-step and leave that option for later, if that happens.

**Pros:**

* More Privacy
* No HOA fee (depending on the community)
* The Area such homes are in are usually secluded or in more calmer locations, away from all the buzz.

**Cons:**

* Lots of things to take care of. (high responsibility)
* May not be convenient depending on how far it is from Amenities.
* Depending on the type of person, interaction with neighbors will be minimal.


####Other types

There are many other affordable types like duplexes, and others, which you can approach on a case to case basis, there are also others like mansions, which is out of the scope for this. But the above three types are the ones that you will mostly come across in all of America. They all are made from wood inside, there is no RCC inside the homes. The only time you will see bricks is probably in the basement or outside-walls. The wood nature of the homes in U.S. make them into a type of huge Lego set, you can make holes anywhere with easy, and still hang heavy things off walls (if you find studs). You can even patch holes if you make one. Everything is easy to do and these are the things you would be learning after living in your own house.
