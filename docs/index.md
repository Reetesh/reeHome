# Buying a house in U.S. 

This will be a House Buying guide for you, yes you, the Resident Alien, or the Non-Resident Alien with a Pending Visa Application, or The almost-Permanent Resident who probably is still Temporary because it takes 10yrs for your Green Card to approve. As an Indian with work visa who is planning to stay here for the foreseeable future and get a Green Card, I feel like my home purchase experience was a bit different from the average American buying a house for their first time. I know, everyone's experience is different, but this guide will cover all the steps as if the future me is explaining it to the past me, and which I hope, will be useful for the others out there who are or will be in the same position as the past me. 

I will cover most of the basic steps and add in a few notes here and there that might make the process a bit different for some (Indian) immigrant in U.S. I recorded all the doubts and justifications I had to go through in order to make myself buy a house, in the form of an interactive story called [The Third Year](http://reetesh.v3r.us/TheThirdYear), it will give a good idea of why you would even go forward with wanting to buy a house, and more personally, why I did.

So let's get started, and find out how you would do the [Search](the-search.md) for the house.
