This Project will be a step-by-step guide on how to buy a house in US. This is all from my experience (Indian citizen, residing in U.S) of buying a house, as a first time home buyer. Most of my explanations will be in the form of information that is given to someone totally new to the process. It will outline most of the major steps and then give some information on foreign national specific requirements and quirks in the process.
